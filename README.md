<li>If there is no text file, it will create a text file in your documents under WumpusTest and HighScores with 10 blank highscores entries (can be changed by altering numberOfHighScores). </li>

<ul><li>Every row is one player and columns are their respective Score, Coins, Arrows, Turns, and Name </ul></li>

<li>Updates the HighScores.txt every press on the UpdateHighScores button (Double clicking&#8594;Double entries)</li>
<li>Display HighScores opens a new form with the highscores formatted.
</ul>
